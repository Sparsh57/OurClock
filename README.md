### 5 Sentence Summary:
KREA University manually creates a spreadsheet using Excel to schedule various courses and generate student timetables. There are numerous software and manual methods available for timetable creation, along with built-in systems in platforms like Canvas. However, these current methods struggle with resolving clashes and managing the complex timetabling needs of professors, resulting in issues for both students and administrators. By using a dynamic programming-based algorithm and a custom UI, the process can be streamlined, allowing for the automatic generation of optimally designed timetables. Our algorithm is mathematically verifiable, and its effectiveness can be tested in real-world scenarios.
